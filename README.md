# Assignment for JavaScript Fundamentals

Follow through the requirements of the next problems and provide the solutions in the `./scripts/app.js` file.

You can choose to either write a function or solve the problem in-place with global variables. Your goal is to make it work, so for now just focus on the happy flow.

## Problem statements

### \# 1
